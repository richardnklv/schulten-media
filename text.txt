  1. Real-time notifications system
    - Install Laravel Echo, Pusher/Socket.io packages
    - Create server-side broadcast events for task updates and assignments
    - Update TaskController to trigger these events
    - Configure websockets server in Laravel
    - Enhance your notificationService.js to connect to Echo
    - Add listeners for task events in the frontend
  2. Comprehensive testing
    - API tests for all endpoints (projects, tasks, comments)
    - Model unit tests to verify relationships
    - Vue component tests, especially for TaskPanel and drag-drop functionality
    - Write at least 15-20 tests total covering core functionality
    - Add CI pipeline configuration
  3. Service layer architecture
    - Create service classes for Tasks, Projects, and Comments
    - Move business logic from controllers to services
    - Implement API Resources for consistent response formatting
    - Add proper pagination for list endpoints
    - Implement robust exception handling
  4. State management and improved frontend
    - Add Pinia/Vuex for centralized state management
    - Create stores for tasks, projects, and notifications
    - Refactor components to use the stores
    - Add loading states and error handling UI
    - Improve form validation with clear feedback
  5. Professional documentation
    - Detailed README with installation instructions
    - API documentation explaining all endpoints
    - Architecture overview explaining design decisions
    - Testing instructions
    - Deployment guide
  6. Code quality improvements
    - Add type declarations in PHP
    - Use Laravel Form Request classes for validation
    - Implement proper authorization with Gates/Policies
    - Create custom exceptions for better error handling
    - Add comprehensive logging
7. Separate files into smaller files
    1. Improve maintainability and readability
  2. Enable better testing of isolated
  functionality
  3. Facilitate component reuse
  4. Demonstrate advanced Vue architecture
  knowledge

  By implementing these improvements, you'll demonstrate mastery of Laravel best practices, Vue.js
  component architecture, and full-stack development principles - exactly what employers look for.

  Focus first on the real-time notifications and testing as they're directly mentioned requirements that        
  are currently missing. Then add the service layer and documentation to showcase your software engineering     
   skills.


     1. Start with testing - Write tests first to
  validate existing functionality before making        
  changes

  2. Add real-time notifications - Directly
  addresses a missing requirement and creates
  visible impact

  3. Refactor Vue components - Break down large        
  components, improve state management

  4. Implement service layer - Move business logic     
   from controllers to services

  5. Add documentation - Create comprehensive
  README and API docs

  6. Enhance error handling - Improve validation       
  and user feedback


  - PINIA across whole VueJS


    1. Notifications in the backend - You need a basic      
  real-time notification system
  2. Testing - Add a few key tests for API endpoints      
  and core functionality
  3. Documentation - A clear README.md explaining
  setup, architecture, and features
